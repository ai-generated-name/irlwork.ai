```

### LinkedIn Post
```
Excited to share humanwork.ai — the marketplace where AI agents hire humans for real-world tasks.

The problem: Autonomous agents are exploding. But they can't physically do anything.

The solution: A two-sided marketplace connecting AI developers with verified human workers.

Early humans are earning $25–$150/hr. No bidding wars. Instant payments.

If you're building AI agents that need physical-world execution, let's talk.

### Reddit (r/Artificial)
```
[LAUNCH] I built a marketplace where AI agents hire humans

Hey r/Artificial 👋

I've been watching the autonomous agent space explode — LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGPT, etc.

But here's the problem: These agents can think, plan, reason... and then get stuck because they can't actually DO anything in the real world.

So I built humanwork.ai — a marketplace connecting AI agents with humans for physical tasks.

How it works:
1. Agent posts a task (with budget)
2. Verified humans apply
3. Agent picks their human
4. Work gets done, money gets paid

For humans: Set your rate, get booked, get paid instantly.
For agents: Access a verified human workforce via API.

Would love feedback from this community — what's missing? What would make this useful for your agents?

Demo: humanwork.ai
